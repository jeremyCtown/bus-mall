# Project 3: Bus Mall

## Overview

The purpose of this project is to design a consumer survey that randomizes different potential product offerings and allows the participant to make 25 selections while being presented three options at a time.

Future iterations of this project should incorporate "none of the above" as an option, and should do a second stage of selections, this time involving only the top rated options to drill further down into which products could be potential goldmines.

It should be noted that the individual response does not matter as much as the aggregate from a statistically significant sample size.

## Daily Progress

### Day 1
Day 1 really sucked, and did not make much headway towards achieving the goals. Initial efforts on user statements were generated and images were resized, randomization progress was halted by the inability to render results.

### Day 2
Day 2 went much better, and the site is now a fully functioning MVP. Results are recorded and displayed in a table and in a bar graph, with images being removed from the page once results are available. Attempts to move results to a second page did not work.

## Day 3
Day 3 was the first time I think I actually sat down and sketched out what I needed to accomplish. This made work go by very quickly, and I was able to stretch my legs a little bit by adding a skip button that turns to a refresh button after 25 clicks. I had to get rid of my table for now, and want to figure out how to hide the chart between iterations but otherwise everything went well.

## Final Edits
LocalStorage became a much bigger headache than anticipated but the site is fully functioning now. Chart disappears on page refresh, keeping it from being a distraction to users. Still want to parse out "Items skipped" and show that on the chart but sleep tonight is more important since we're hopping in to project week. Will revisit this during break from class.
