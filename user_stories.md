##Marketing Research Team
As a Market Research Team Member, I want a ubiquitous tool that randomizes the display of potential Bus Mall Products so I can aggregate consumer preferences over a statistically significant sample size to ensure only relevant products are promoted.

##Developer
As a developer, I want to create a user-friendly interface that easily aggregates data for the marketing research team the first time so they don't bother me multiple times a day with tiny edits (which is going to happen anyway.)

##Focus Group Participant
As a focus group participant, I want a painless survey tool that provides satisfactory input to the market research team so I can get my compensation I was promised for participating.
