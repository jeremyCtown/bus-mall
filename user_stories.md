# User Stories

## Marketing Research Team

### Team Leader
As the Team Leader, I want a tool designed that accurately captures user preferences so I can confidently report study findings and begin work on the next phase of our strategy.

### Lead Analyst
As the Lead Analyst, I want a ubiquitous tool that randomizes the display of potential Bus Mall Products so I can aggregate consumer preferences over a statistically significant sample size to ensure only relevant products are promoted.

### Lead Designer
As the Lead Designer, I want to design a survey that is unambiguous in its intent and easy to use so I can make sure the insights I'm capturing from consumers are representative of their actual preferences.

### Junior Analyst
As a Junior Analyst, I just want the survey tool to work so I don't get blamed because I'm the most junior person on the team.

## Developers
### Lead Developer
As the Lead Developer, I want my team to develop a fully functioning bug-free application that randomizes images and accurately tracks and stores user input so I can continue to be seen as a reliable developer and be considered for future advancement.

### Software Engineer
As a Software Engineer, I want to create a user-friendly interface that easily aggregates data for the marketing research team the first time so they don't bother me multiple times a day with tiny edits (which is going to happen anyway.)

### Data Scientist
As a Data Scientist, I want to track more information than initially requested so our team can parse out user intent by studying the additional metrics. Plus, the market research team will probably ask for them soon anyway.

### Web Designer
As the Web Designer, I want to ensure the application works on multiple size screens to include mobile while keeping it aesthically pleasing for the user so we can get a better response rate because of ease of availability.

### Hamed
As a focus group participant, I want to use this experience to learn more about consumer marketing so I can take my lessons learned back to my business and see how I can replicate these techniques.

### Jamie
